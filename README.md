# Project-Story
A Bukkit plugin for dynamic quests and characters, that are tailored to your world.

Project Story is all about bringing depth and story to your Minecraft world. Interactive NPCs that can recognize different players, automatically-generated quests and events, and even artifacts and loot, all generated on-the-fly, and tailored to the specific player and world.

# Features
## Auto-Quest
Quests are an important feature of any RPG-style world, but they can be time-consuming to create, and aren’t dynamic in any way, so they can get repetitive for players. But with Project Story, no quest is set in stone.

Quests are generated as needed, by looking for suitable objectives for the player to complete, and assembling them into a unique quest. So, when a player asks an NPC for a quest, they get a brand new quest, made from random objectives that (optionally) meet certain criteria.

You can still create quests manually, and can still include dynamic objectives from Auto-Quest, to create story-driven quests that are fresh and exciting for new and old players.

## Interactive NPCs
Citizens NPCs can be tagged in Project Story, to define their behavior towards the player and other NPCs. Define a tag’s behavior once, and apply that tag to any number of NPCs. Easily create a dozen townspeople with similar dialogue and behavior, with just a single tag.

NPCs can have interactive dialogue, using clickable Prompts from Project CoRE. Create a list of dialogue and possible responses that the player can choose. Optionally, hide or show dialogue and responses based on certain criteria.

NPCs can be created automatically with tags. Quickly fill a town with interactive NPCs, by tagging the town’s location, and pre-tagged NPCs will be able to spawn there. Paired with Auto-Quest, these NPCs can give dynamic quests to players, making it easy to fill a town with gameplay.

## Tags
Tags are the heart of Project Story. They identify everything in the world, define how they should be treated, and define how they should behave. Any entity (including players and NPCs), as well as locations, objectives, and items, can be tagged.

Imagine you have a nation in your world, called Waramon. A Waramon tag can be applied to all NPCs, locations, activities, and players that are part of the nation. This will cause the NPCs to recognize the players as allies, and they could give quests for objectives within the nation.

A blacksmith NPC may have a second tag, “blacksmith“. Objectives, such as a weapon shop awaiting a delivery, or a mine that requires help, may be also tagged with “blacksmith”. If the player asks the blacksmith NPC for a quest, Auto-Quest would generate quests involving these objectives, because they share the same tags.

Another nation, called Yongaron,  may have it’s objects tagged as “Yongaron“. The Yongaron tag could include behavior to treat Waramon as an enemy. Now, Yongaron NPCs will fight against Waramon NPCs and players. Yongaron players may receive quests from their NPCs, to go fight at Waramon locations.

## Flexible and powerful, yet simple
Like all of our plugins, Project Story is highly customizable, and all features are optional. Each tag can use as many or as few features as desired.

You can choose to only include NPC dialogue, and ignore all other features. Auto-Quest only creates quests when needed, so it has no impact if you choose not to use it.

Many objects are pre-tagged (players have their realm and title, Warpstones are tagged locations), so you can get started quickly, or define your own tags. Other plugins can supply their own tags and objects, which can be used to extend the capabilities of Project Story.

There is no limit to the number of tags you can use. More tagged objects will increase the possibilities for dynamic content and Auto-Quests.
